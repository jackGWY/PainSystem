Its targets include: protein kinase B (PKB/AKT1, PKB/AKT2, PKB/AKT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2 and RPS6KA3), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACA), protein kinase C (PRKCD and PRKCZ), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3), p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), protein kinase PKN (PKN1 and PKN2). Plays a central role in the transduction of signals from insulin by providing the activating phosphorylation to PKB/AKT1, thus propagating the signal to downstream targets controlling cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and amino acid uptake and storage. Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF-kappa-B activation in macrophages. Isoform 3 is catalytically inactive.','PDPK1','63151.305','DB00482','>lcl|BSEQ0021289|3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1)\nATGGCCAGGACCACCAGCCAGCTGTATGACGCCGTGCCCATCCAGTCCAGCGTGGTGTTA\nTGTTCCTGCCCATCCCCATCAATGGTGAGGACCCAGACTGAGTCCAGCACGCCCCCTGGC\nATTCCTGGTGGCAGCAGGCAGGGCCCCGCCATGGACGGCACTGCAGCCGAGCCTCGGCCC\nGGCGCCGGCTCCCTGCAGCATGCCCAGCCTCCGCCGCAGCCTCGGAAGAAGCGGCCTGAG\nGACTTCAAGTTTGGGAAAATCCTTGGGGAAGGCTCTTTTTCCACGGTTGTCCTGGCTCGA\nGAACTGGCAACCTCCAGAGAATATGCGATTAAAATTCTGGAGAAGCGACATATCATAAAA\nGAGAACAAGGTCCCCTATGTAACCAGAGAGCGGGATGTCATGTCGCGCCTGGATCACCCC\nTTCTTTGTTAAGCTTTACTTCACATTTCAGGACGACGAGAAGCTGTATTTCGGCCTTAGT\nTATGCCAAAAATGGAGAACTACTTAAATATATTCGCAAAATCGGTTCATTCGATGAGACC\nTGTACCCGATTTTACACGGCTGAGATTGTGTCTGCTTTAGAGTACTTGCACGGCAAGGGC\nATCATTCACAGGGACCTTAAACCGGAAAACATTTTGTTAAATGAAGATATGCACATCCAG\nATCACAGATTTTGGAACAGCAAAAGTCTTATCCCCAGAGAGCAAACAAGCCAGGGCCAAC\nTCATTCGTGGGAACAGCGCAGTACGTTTCTCCAGAGCTGCTCACGGAGAAGTCCGCCTGT\nAAGAGTTCAGACCTTTGGGCTCTTGGATGCATAATATACCAGCTTGTGGCAGGACTCCCA\nCCATTCCGAGCTGGAAACGAGTATCTTATATTTCAGAAGATCATTAAGTTGGAATATGAC\nTTTCCAGAAAAATTCTTCCCTAAGGCAAGAGACCTCGTGGAGAAACTTTTGGTTTTAGAT\nGCCACAAAGCGGTTAGGCTGTGAGGAAATGGAAGGATACGGACCTCTTAAAGCACACCCG\nTTCTTCGAGTCCGTCACGTGGGAGAACCTGCACCAGCAGACGCCTCCGAAGCTCACCGCT\nTACCTGCCGGCTATGTCGGAAGACGACGAGGACTGCTATGGCAATTATGACAATCTCCTG\nAGCCAGTTTGGCTGCATGCAGGTGTCTTCGTCCTCCTCCTCACACTCCCTGTCAGCCTCC\nGACACGGGCCTGCCCCAGAGGTCAGGCAGCAACATAGAGCAGTACATTCACGATCTGGAC\nTCGAACTCCTTTGAACTGGACTTACAGTTTTCCGAAGATGAGAAGAGGTTGTTGTTGGAG\nAAGCAGGCTGGCGGAAACCCTTGCCTAACAGGACGTATTATCTGA'),('5\'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1','None','Human','Tau-protein kinase activity','Catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism. In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation. AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin. Regulates lipid synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating lipid metabolic enzymes such as ACACA, ACACB, GYS1, HMGCR and LIPE; regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis by phosphorylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA and ACACB) and hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) enzymes, respectively. Regulates insulin-signaling and glycolysis by phosphorylating IRS1, PFKFB2 and PFKFB3. AMPK stimulates glucose uptake in muscle by increasing the translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, possibly by mediating phosphorylation of TBC1D4/AS160. Regulates transcription and chromatin structure by phosphorylating transcription regulators involved in energy metabolism such as CRTC2/TORC2, FOXO3, histone H2B, HDAC5, MEF2C, MLXIPL/ChREBP, EP300, HNF4A, p53/TP53, SREBF1, SREBF2 and PPARGC1A. Acts as a key regulator of glucose homeostasis in liver by phosphorylating CRTC2/TORC2, leading to CRTC2/TORC2 sequestration in the cytoplasm. In response to stress, phosphorylates \'Ser-36\' of histone H2B (H2BS36ph), leading to promote transcription. Acts as a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating TSC2, RPTOR and ATG1/ULK1: in response to nutrient limitation, negatively regulates the mTORC1 complex by phosphorylating RPTOR component of the mTORC1 complex and by phosphorylating and activating TSC2. In response to nutrient limitation, promotes autophagy by phosphorylating and activating ATG1/ULK1. AMPK also acts as a regulator of circadian rhythm by mediating phosphorylation of CRY1, leading to destabilize it. May regulate the Wnt signaling pathway by phosphorylating CTNNB1, leading to stabilize it. Also has tau-protein kinase activity: in response to amyloid beta A4 protein (APP) exposure, activated by CAMKK2, leading to phosphorylation of MAPT/TAU; however the relevance of such data remains unclear in vivo. Also phosphorylates CFTR, EEF2K, KLC1, NOS3 and SLC12A1.','PRKAA1','64008.64','DB00945','>lcl|BSEQ0010471|5\'-AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha-1 (PRKAA1)\nATGCGCAGACTCAGTTCCTGGAGAAAGATGGCGACAGCCGAGAAGCAGAAACACGACGGG\nCGGGTGAAGATCGGCCACTACATTCTGGGTGACACGCTGGGGGTCGGCACCTTCGGCAAA\nGTGAAGGTTGGCAAACATGAATTGACTGGGCATAAAGTAGCTGTGAAGATACTCAATCGA\nCAGAAGATTCGGAGCCTTGATGTGGTAGGAAAAATCCGCAGAGAAATTCAGAACCTCAAG\nCTTTTCAGGCATCCTCATATAATTAAACTGTACCAGGTCATCAGTACACCATCTGATATT\nTTCATGGTGATGGAATATGTCTCAGGAGGAGAGCTATTTGATTATATCTGTAAGAATGGA\nAGGCTGGATGAAAAAGAAAGTCGGCGTCTGTTCCAACAGATCCTTTCTGGTGTGGATTAT\nTGTCACAGGCATATGGTGGTCCATAGAGATTTGAAACCTGAAAATGTCCTGCTTGATGCA\nCACATGAATGCAAAGATAGCTGATTTTGGTCTTTCAAACATGATGTCAGATGGTGAATTT\nTTAAGAACAAGTTGTGGCTCACCCAACTATGCTGCACCAGAAGTAATTTCAGGAAGATTG\nTATGCAGGCCCAGAGGTAGATATATGGAGCAGTGGGGTTATTCTCTATGCTTTATTATGT\nGGAACCCTTCCATTTGATGATGACCATGTGCCAACTCTTTTTAAGAAGATATGTGATGGG\nATCTTCTATACCCCTCAATATTTAAATCCTTCTGTGATTAGCCTTTTGAAACATATGCTG\nCAGGTGGATCCCATGAAGAGGGCCACAATCAAAGATATCAGGGAACATGAATGGTTTAAA\nCAGGACCTTCCAAAATATCTCTTTCCTGAGGATCCATCATATAGTTCAACCATGATTGAT\nGATGAAGCCTTAAAAGAAGTATGTGAAAAGTTTGAGTGCTCAGAAGAGGAAGTTCTCAGC\nTGTCTTTACAACAGAAATCACCAGGATCCTTTGGCAGTTGCCTACCATCTCATAATAGAT\nAACAGGAGAATAATGAATGAAGCCAAAGATTTCTATTTGGCGACAAGCCCACCTGATTCT\nTTTCTTGATGATCATCACCTGACTCGGCCCCATCCTGAAAGAGTACCATTCTTGGTTGCT\nGAAACACCAAGGGCACGCCATACCCTTGATGAATTAAATCCACAGAAATCCAAACACCAA\nGGTGTAAGGAAAGCAAAATGGCATTTAGGAATTAGAAGTCAAAGTCGACCAAATGATATT\nATGGCAGAAGTATGTAGAGCAATCAAACAATTGGATTATGAATGGAAGGTTGTAAACCCA\nTATTATTTGCGTGTACGAAGGAAGAATCCTGTGACAAGCACTTACTCCAAAATGAGTCTA\nCAGTTATACCAAGTGGATAGTAGAACTTATCTACTGGATTTCCGTAGTATTGATGATGAA\nATTACAGAAGCCAAATCAGGGACTGCTACTCCACAGAGATCGGGATCAGTTAGCAACTAT\nCGATCTTGCCAAAGGAGTGATTCAGATGCTGAGGCTCAAGGAAAATCCTCAGAAGTTTCT\nCTTACCTCATCTGTGACCTCACTTGACTCTTCTCCTGTTGACCTAACTCCAAGACCTGGA\nAGTCACACAATAGAATTTTTTGAGATGTGTGCAAATCTAATTAAAATTCTTGCACAATAA'),('5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1','protein group','Human','None','None','None','None','DB01221','None'),('5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A','None','Human','Serotonin receptor activity','G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin).

Isoform 2 can also transport potassium, but with lower efficiency. It is nearly impermeable to the larger rubidium and cesium ions. Isoform 3 can also transport calcium ions. Mediates glutamate-independent Ca(2+) entry into neurons upon acidosis. This Ca(2+) overloading is toxic for cortical neurons and may be in part responsible for ischemic brain injury. Heteromeric channel assembly seems to modulate channel properties.

Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibits Notch signaling through interaction with Numb. Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity (By similarity). Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1. Involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1.Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, can reduce Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) to Cu(+) and Fe(2+), respectively. Beta-amyloid 42 is a more effective reductant than beta-amyloid 40. Beta-amyloid peptides bind to lipoproteins and apolipoproteins E and J in the CSF and to HDL particles in plasma, inhibiting metal-catalyzed oxidation of lipoproteins. Beta-APP42 may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicit inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Interaction with overexpressed HADH2 leads to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Also binds GPC1 in lipid rafts.Appicans elicit adhesion of neural cells to the extracellular matrix and may regulate neurite outgrowth in the brain.The gamma-CTF peptides as well as the caspase-cleaved peptides, including C31, are potent enhancers of neuronal apoptosis.N-APP binds TNFRSF21 triggering caspase activation and degeneration of both neuronal cell bodies (via caspase-3) and axons (via caspase-6).','APP','86942.715','DB02709','>lcl|BSEQ0019416|Amyloid beta A4 protein (APP)\nATGCTGCCCGGTTTGGCACTGCTCCTGCTGGCCGCCTGGACGGCTCGGGCGCTGGAGGTA\nCCCACTGATGGTAATGCTGGCCTGCTGGCTGAACCCCAGATTGCCATGTTCTGTGGCAGA\nCTGAACATGCACATGAATGTCCAGAATGGGAAGTGGGATTCAGATCCATCAGGGACCAAA\nACCTGCATTGATACCAAGGAAGGCATCCTGCAGTATTGCCAAGAAGTCTACCCTGAACTG\nCAGATCACCAATGTGGTAGAAGCCAACCAACCAGTGACCATCCAGAACTGGTGCAAGCGG\nGGCCGCAAGCAGTGCAAGACCCATCCCCACTTTGTGATTCCCTACCGCTGCTTAGTTGGT\nGAGTTTGTAAGTGATGCCCTTCTCGTTCCTGACAAGTGCAAATTCTTACACCAGGAGAGG\nATGGATGTTTGCGAAACTCATCTTCACTGGCACACCGTCGCCAAAGAGACATGCAGTGAG\nAAGAGTACCAACTTGCATGACTACGGCATGTTGCTGCCCTGCGGAATTGACAAGTTCCGA\nGGGGTAGAGTTTGTGTGTTGCCCACTGGCTGAAGAAAGTGACAATGTGGATTCTGCTGAT\nGCGGAGGAGGATGACTCGGATGTCTGGTGGGGCGGAGCAGACACAGACTATGCAGATGGG\nAGTGAAGACAAAGTAGTAGAAGTAGCAGAGGAGGAAGAAGTGGCTGAGGTGGAAGAAGAA\nGAAGCCGATGATGACGAGGACGATGAGGATGGTGATGAGGTAGAGGAAGAGGCTGAGGAA\nCCCTACGAAGAAGCCACAGAGAGAACCACCAGCATTGCCACCACCACCACCACCACCACA\nGAGTCTGTGGAAGAGGTGGTTCGAGAGGTGTGCTCTGAACAAGCCGAGACGGGGCCGTGC\nCGAGCAATGATCTCCCGCTGGTACTTTGATGTGACTGAAGGGAAGTGTGCCCCATTCTTT\nTACGGCGGATGTGGCGGCAACCGGAACAACTTTGACACAGAAGAGTACTGCATGGCCGTG\nTGTGGCAGCGCCATGTCCCAAAGTTTACTCAAGACTACCCAGGAACCTCTTGCCCGAGAT\nCCTGTTAAACTTCCTACAACAGCAGCCAGTACCCCTGATGCCGTTGACAAGTATCTCGAG\nACACCTGGGGATGAGAATGAACATGCCCATTTCCAGAAAGCCAAAGAGAGGCTTGAGGCC\nAAGCACCGAGAGAGAATGTCCCAGGTCATGAGAGAATGGGAAGAGGCAGAACGTCAAGCA\nAAGAACTTGCCTAAAGCTGATAAGAAGGCAGTTATCCAGCATTTCCAGGAGAAAGTGGAA\nTCTTTGGAACAGGAAGCAGCCAACGAGAGACAGCAGCTGGTGGAGACACACATGGCCAGA\nGTGGAAGCCATGCTCAATGACCGCCGCCGCCTGGCCCTGGAGAACTACATCACCGCTCTG\nCAGGCTGTTCCTCCTCGGCCTCGTCACGTGTTCAATATGCTAAAGAAGTATGTCCGCGCA\nGAACAGAAGGACAGACAGCACACCCTAAAGCATTTCGAGCATGTGCGCATGGTGGATCCC\nAAGAAAGCCGCTCAGATCCGGTCCCAGGTTATGACACACCTCCGTGTGATTTATGAGCGC\nATGAATCAGTCTCTCTCCCTGCTCTACAACGTGCCTGCAGTGGCCGAGGAGATTCAGGAT\nGAAGTTGATGAGCTGCTTCAGAAAGAGCAAAACTATTCAGATGACGTCTTGGCCAACATG\nATTAGTGAACCAAGGATCAGTTACGGAAACGATGCTCTCATGCCATCTTTGACCGAAACG\nAAAACCACCGTGGAGCTCCTTCCCGTGAATGGAGAGTTCAGCCTGGACGATCTCCAGCCG\nTGGCATTCTTTTGGGGCTGACTCTGTGCCAGCCAACACAGAAAACGAAGTTGAGCCTGTT\nGATGCCCGCCCTGCTGCCGACCGAGGACTGACCACTCGACCAGGTTCTGGGTTGACAAAT\nATCAAGACGGAGGAGATCTCTGAAGTGAAGATGGATGCAGAATTCCGACATGACTCAGGA\nTATGAAGTTCATCATCAAAAATTGGTGTTCTTTGCAGAAGATGTGGGTTCAAACAAAGGT\nGCAATCATTGGACTCATGGTGGGCGGTGTTGTCATAGCGACAGTGATCGTCATCACCTTG\nGTGATGCTGAAGAAGAAACAGTACACATCCATTCATCATGGTGTGGTGGAGGTTGACGCC\nGCTGTCACCCCAGAGGAGCGCCACCTGTCCAAGATGCAGCAGAACGGCTACGAAAATCCA\nACCTACAAGTTCTTTGAGCAGATGCAGAACTAG'),('Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2','None','Human','Ubiquitin protein ligase binding','Suppresses apoptosis in a variety of cell systems including factor-dependent lymphohematopoietic and neural cells.

Receptor for BDNF/brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NTF4/neurotrophin-4. Alternatively can also bind NTF3/neurotrophin-3 which is less efficient in activating the receptor but regulates neuron survival through NTRK2. Upon ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation. Recruits, phosphorylates and/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades. Through SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 activates the GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates for instance neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Through the same effectors controls the Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that mainly regulates growth and survival. Through PLCG1 and the downstream protein kinase C-regulated pathways controls synaptic plasticity. Thereby, plays a role in learning and memory by regulating both short term synaptic function and long-term potentiation. PLCG1 also leads to NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival. Hence, it is able to suppress anoikis, the apoptosis resulting from loss of cell-matrix interactions.

Regulates numerous cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis and transcription, as well as viral infection. May act as a regulatory node which integrates and coordinates numerous signals leading to an appropriate cellular response. During mitosis, functions as a component of the p53/TP53-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that maintains cyclin-B-CDK1 activity and G2 arrest in response to spindle damage. Also required for p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis, phosphorylating \'Ser-392\' of p53/TP53 following UV irradiation. Can also negatively regulate apoptosis. Phosphorylates the caspases CASP9 and CASP2 and the apoptotic regulator NOL3. Phosphorylation protects CASP9 from cleavage and activation by CASP8, and inhibits the dimerization of CASP2 and activation of CASP8. Regulates transcription by direct phosphorylation of RNA polymerases I, II, III and IV. Also phosphorylates and regulates numerous transcription factors including NF-kappa-B, STAT1, CREB1, IRF1, IRF2, ATF1, SRF, MAX, JUN, FOS, MYC and MYB. Phosphorylates Hsp90 and its co-chaperones FKBP4 and CDC37, which is essential for chaperone function. Regulates Wnt signaling by phosphorylating CTNNB1 and the transcription factor LEF1. Acts as an ectokinase that phosphorylates several extracellular proteins. During viral infection, phosphorylates various proteins involved in the viral life cycles of EBV, HSV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV and HPV. Phosphorylates PML at \'Ser-565\' and primes it for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

The steroid hormones and their receptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivation involves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP-1/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand binding induces a conformational change allowing subsequent or combinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexes through LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutual transrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF-kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription from the IL6 promoter and displace RELA/p65 and associated coregulators from the promoter. Recruited to the NF-kappa-B response element of the CCL2 and IL8 promoters and can displace CREBBP. Present with NF-kappa-B components RELA/p65 and NFKB1/p50 on ERE sequences. Can also act synergistically with NF-kappa-B to activate transcription involving respective recruitment adjacent response elements; the function involves CREBBP. Can activate the transcriptional activity of TFF1. Also mediates membrane-initiated estrogen signaling involving various kinase cascades. Isoform 3 is involved in activation of NOS3 and endothelial nitric oxide production. Isoforms lacking one or several functional domains are thought to modulate transcriptional activity by competitive ligand or DNA binding and/or heterodimerization with the full length receptor.

However, NTF3 only supports axonal extension through NTRK1 but has no effect on neuron survival. Upon dimeric NGF ligand-binding, undergoes homodimerization, autophosphorylation and activation. Recruits, phosphorylates and/or activates several downstream effectors including SHC1, FRS2, SH2B1, SH2B2 and PLCG1 that regulate distinct overlapping signaling cascades driving cell survival and differentiation. Through SHC1 and FRS2 activates a GRB2-Ras-MAPK cascade that regulates cell differentiation and survival. Through PLCG1 controls NF-Kappa-B activation and the transcription of genes involved in cell survival. Through SHC1 and SH2B1 controls a Ras-PI3 kinase-AKT1 signaling cascade that is also regulating survival. In absence of ligand and activation, may promote cell death, making the survival of neurons dependent on trophic factors.Isoform TrkA-III is resistant to NGF, constitutively activates AKT1 and NF-kappa-B and is unable to activate the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade. Antagonizes the anti-proliferative NGF-NTRK1 signaling that promotes neuronal precursors differentiation.

Probably acts as an adapter that recognizes polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and target them to the aggresome, facilitating their clearance by autophagy.','HDAC6','131418.19','DB13346','>lcl|BSEQ0021857|Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)\nATGACCTCAACCGGCCAGGATTCCACCACAACCAGGCAGCGAAGAAGTAGGCAGAACCCC\nCAGTCGCCCCCTCAGGACTCCAGTGTCACTTCGAAGCGAAATATTAAAAAGGGAGCCGTT\nCCCCGCTCTATCCCCAATCTAGCGGAGGTAAAGAAGAAAGGCAAAATGAAGAAGCTCGGC\nCAAGCAATGGAAGAAGACCTAATCGTGGGACTGCAAGGGATGGATCTGAACCTTGAGGCT\nGAAGCACTGGCTGGCACTGGCTTGGTGTTGGATGAGCAGTTAAATGAATTCCATTGCCTC\nTGGGATGACAGCTTCCCGGAAGGCCCTGAGCGGCTCCATGCCATCAAGGAGCAACTGATC\nCAGGAGGGCCTCCTAGATCGCTGCGTGTCCTTTCAGGCCCGGTTTGCTGAAAAGGAAGAG\nCTGATGTTGGTTCACAGCCTAGAATATATTGATCTGATGGAAACAACCCAGTACATGAAT\nGAGGGAGAACTCCGTGTCCTAGCAGACACCTACGACTCAGTTTATCTGCATCCGAACTCA\nTACTCCTGTGCCTGCCTGGCCTCAGGCTCTGTCCTCAGGCTGGTGGATGCGGTCCTGGGG\nGCTGAGATCCGGAATGGCATGGCCATCATTAGGCCTCCTGGACATCACGCCCAGCACAGT\nCTTATGGATGGCTATTGCATGTTCAACCACGTGGCTGTGGCAGCCCGCTATGCTCAACAG\nAAACACCGCATCCGGAGGGTCCTTATCGTAGATTGGGATGTGCACCACGGTCAAGGAACA\nCAGTTCACCTTCGACCAGGACCCCAGTGTCCTCTATTTCTCCATCCACCGCTACGAGCAG\nGGTAGGTTCTGGCCCCACCTGAAGGCCTCTAACTGGTCCACCACAGGTTTCGGCCAAGGC\nCAAGGATATACCATCAATGTGCCTTGGAACCAGGTGGGGATGCGGGATGCTGACTACATT\nGCTGCTTTCCTGCACGTCCTGCTGCCAGTCGCCCTCGAGTTCCAGCCTCAGCTGGTCCTG\nGTGGCTGCTGGATTTGATGCCCTGCAAGGGGACCCCAAGGGTGAGATGGCCGCCACTCCG\nGCAGGGTTCGCCCAGCTAACCCACCTGCTCATGGGTCTGGCAGGAGGCAAGCTGATCCTG\nTCTCTGGAGGGTGGCTACAACCTCCGCGCCCTGGCTGAAGGCGTCAGTGCTTCGCTCCAC\nACCCTTCTGGGAGACCCTTGCCCCATGCTGGAGTCACCTGGTGCCCCCTGCCGGAGTGCC\nCAGGCTTCAGTTTCCTGTGCTCTGGAAGCCCTTGAGCCCTTCTGGGAGGTTCTTGTGAGA\nTCAACTGAGACCGTGGAGAGGGACAACATGGAGGAGGACAATGTAGAGGAGAGCGAGGAG\nGAAGGACCCTGGGAGCCCCCTGTGCTCCCAATCCTGACATGGCCAGTGCTACAGTCTCGC\nACAGGGCTGGTCTATGACCAAAATATGATGAATCACTGCAACTTGTGGGACAGCCACCAC\nCCTGAGGTACCCCAGCGCATCTTGCGGATCATGTGCCGTCTGGAGGAGCTGGGCCTTGCC\nGGGCGCTGCCTCACCCTGACACCGCGCCCTGCCACAGAGGCTGAGCTGCTCACCTGTCAC\nAGTGCTGAGTACGTGGGTCATCTCCGGGCCACAGAGAAAATGAAAACCCGGGAGCTGCAC\nCGTGAGAGTTCCAACTTTGACTCCATCTATATCTGCCCCAGTACCTTCGCCTGTGCACAG\nCTTGCCACTGGCGCTGCCTGCCGCCTGGTGGAGGCTGTGCTCTCAGGAGAGGTTCTGAAT\nGGTGCTGCTGTGGTGCGTCCCCCAGGACACCACGCAGAGCAGGATGCAGCTTGCGGTTTT\nTGCTTTTTCAACTCTGTGGCTGTGGCTGCTCGCCATGCCCAGACTATCAGTGGGCATGCC\nCTACGGATCCTGATTGTGGATTGGGATGTCCACCACGGTAATGGAACTCAGCACATGTTT\nGAGGATGACCCCAGTGTGCTATATGTGTCCCTGCACCGCTATGATCATGGCACCTTCTTC\nCCCATGGGGGATGAGGGTGCCAGCAGCCAGATCGGCCGGGCTGCGGGCACAGGCTTCACC\nGTCAACGTGGCATGGAACGGGCCCCGCATGGGTGATGCTGACTACCTAGCTGCCTGGCAT\nCGCCTGGTGCTTCCCATTGCCTACGAGTTTAACCCAGAACTGGTGCTGGTCTCAGCTGGC\nTTTGATGCTGCACGGGGGGATCCGCTGGGGGGCTGCCAGGTGTCACCTGAGGGTTATGCC\nCACCTCACCCACCTGCTGATGGGCCTTGCCAGTGGCCGCATTATCCTTATCCTAGAGGGT\nGGCTATAACCTGACATCCATCTCAGAGTCCATGGCTGCCTGCACTCGCTCCCTCCTTGGA\nGACCCACCACCCCTGCTGACCCTGCCACGGCCCCCACTATCAGGGGCCCTGGCCTCAATC\nACTGAGACCATCCAAGTCCATCGCAGATACTGGCGCAGCTTACGGGTCATGAAGGTAGAA\nGACAGAGAAGGACCCTCCAGTTCTAAGTTGGTCACCAAGAAGGCACCCCAACCAGCCAAA\nCCTAGGTTAGCTGAGCGGATGACCACACGAGAAAAGAAGGTTCTGGAAGCAGGCATGGGG\nAAAGTCACCTCGGCATCATTTGGGGAAGAGTCCACTCCAGGCCAGACTAACTCAGAGACA\nGCTGTGGTGGCCCTCACTCAGGACCAGCCCTCAGAGGCAGCCACAGGGGGAGCCACTCTG\nGCCCAGACCATTTCTGAGGCAGCCATTGGGGGAGCCATGCTGGGCCAGACCACCTCAGAG\nGAGGCTGTCGGGGGAGCCACTCCGGACCAGACCACCTCAGAGGAGACTGTGGGAGGAGCC\nATTCTGGACCAGACCACCTCAGAGGATGCTGTTGGGGGAGCCACGCTGGGCCAGACTACC\nTCAGAGGAGGCTGTAGGAGGAGCTACACTGGCCCAGACCACCTCGGAGGCAGCCATGGAG\nGGAGCCACACTGGACCAGACTACGTCAGAGGAGGCTCCAGGGGGCACCGAGCTGATCCAA\nACTCCTCTAGCCTCGAGCACAGACCACCAGACCCCCCCAACCTCACCTGTGCAGGGAACT\nACACCCCAGATATCTCCCAGTACACTGATTGGGAGTCTCAGGACCTTGGAGCTAGGCAGC\nGAATCTCAGGGGGCCTCAGAATCTCAGGCCCCAGGAGAGGAGAACCTACTAGGAGAGGCA\nGCTGGAGGTCAGGACATGGCTGATTCGATGCTGATGCAGGGATCTAGGGGCCTCACTGAT\nCAGGCCATATTTTATGCTGTGACACCACTGCCCTGGTGTCCCCATTTGGTGGCAGTATGC\nCCCATACCTGCAGCAGGCCTAGACGTGACCCAACCTTGTGGGGACTGTGGAACAATCCAA\nGAGAATTGGGTGTGTCTCTCTTGCTATCAGGTCTACTGTGGTCGTTACATCAATGGCCAC\nATGCTCCAACACCATGGAAATTCTGGACACCCGCTGGTCCTCAGCTACATCGACCTGTCA\nGCCTGGTGTTACTACTGTCAGGCCTATGTCCACCACCAGGCTCTCCTAGATGTGAAGAAC\nATCGCCCACCAGAACAAGTTTGGGGAGGATATGCCCCACCCACACTAA'),('Ig gamma-2 chain C region','None','Human','Immunoglobulin receptor binding','None','IGHG2','35900.445','DB04688','None'),('Ig kappa chain C region','None','Human','Immunoglobulin receptor binding','None','IGKC','11608.765','DB04688','None'),('Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha','None','Human','Scaffold protein binding','Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Participates also in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities. Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at \'Ser-10\' that are subsequently acetylated at \'Lys-14\' by CREBBP. Additionally, phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260).','CHUK','84638.88','DB00795','>lcl|BSEQ0013243|Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (CHUK)\nATGGAGCGGCCCCCGGGGCTGCGGCCGGGCGCGGGCGGGCCCTGGGAGATGCGGGAGCGG\nCTGGGCACCGGCGGCTTCGGGAACGTCTGTCTGTACCAGCATCGGGAACTTGATCTCAAA\nATAGCAATTAAGTCTTGTCGCCTAGAGCTAAGTACCAAAAACAGAGAACGATGGTGCCAT\nGAAATCCAGATTATGAAGAAGTTGAACCATGCCAATGTTGTAAAGGCCTGTGATGTTCCT\nGAAGAATTGAATATTTTGATTCATGATGTGCCTCTTCTAGCAATGGAATACTGTTCTGGA\nGGAGATCTCCGAAAGCTGCTCAACAAACCAGAAAATTGTTGTGGACTTAAAGAAAGCCAG\nATACTTTCTTTACTAAGTGATATAGGGTCTGGGATTCGATATTTGCATGAAAACAAAATT\nATACATCGAGATCTAAAACCTGAAAACATAGTTCTTCAGGATGTTGGTGGAAAGATAATA\nCATAAAATAATTGATCTGGGATATGCCAAAGATGTTGATCAAGGAAGTCTGTGTACATCT\nTTTGTGGGAACACTGCAGTATCTGGCCCCAGAGCTCTTTGAGAATAAGCCTTACACAGCC\nACTGTTGATTATTGGAGCTTTGGGACCATGGTATTTGAATGTATTGCTGGATATAGGCCT\nTTTTTGCATCATCTGCAGCCATTTACCTGGCATGAGAAGATTAAGAAGAAGGATCCAAAG\nTGTATATTTGCATGTGAAGAGATGTCAGGAGAAGTTCGGTTTAGTAGCCATTTACCTCAA\nCCAAATAGCCTTTGTAGTTTAGTAGTAGAACCCATGGAAAACTGGCTACAGTTGATGTTG\nAATTGGGACCCTCAGCAGAGAGGAGGACCTGTTGACCTTACTTTGAAGCAGCCAAGATGT\nTTTGTATTAATGGATCACATTTTGAATTTGAAGATAGTACACATCCTAAATATGACTTCT\nGCAAAGATAATTTCTTTTCTGTTACCACCTGATGAAAGTCTTCATTCACTACAGTCTCGT\nATTGAGCGTGAAACTGGAATAAATACTGGTTCTCAAGAACTTCTTTCAGAGACAGGAATT\nTCTCTGGATCCTCGGAAACCAGCCTCTCAATGTGTTCTAGATGGAGTTAGAGGCTGTGAT\nAGCTATATGGTTTATTTGTTTGATAAAAGTAAAACTGTATATGAAGGGCCATTTGCTTCC\nAGAAGTTTATCTGATTGTGTAAATTATATTGTACAGGACAGCAAAATACAGCTTCCAATT\nATACAGCTGCGTAAAGTGTGGGCTGAAGCAGTGCACTATGTGTCTGGACTAAAAGAAGAC\nTATAGCAGGCTCTTTCAGGGACAAAGGGCAGCAATGTTAAGTCTTCTTAGATATAATGCT\nAACTTAACAAAAATGAAGAACACTTTGATCTCAGCATCACAACAACTGAAAGCTAAATTG\nGAGTTTTTTCACAAAAGCATTCAGCTTGACTTGGAGAGATACAGCGAGCAGATGACGTAT\nGGGATATCTTCAGAAAAAATGCTAAAAGCATGGAAAGAAATGGAAGAAAAGGCCATCCAC\nTATGCTGAGGTTGGTGTCATTGGATACCTGGAGGATCAGATTATGTCTTTGCATGCTGAA\nATCATGGAGCTACAGAAGAGCCCCTATGGAAGACGTCAGGGAGACTTGATGGAATCTCTG\nGAACAGCGTGCCATTGATCTATATAAGCAGTTAAAACACAGACCTTCAGATCACTCCTAC\nAGTGACAGCACAGAGATGGTGAAAATCATTGTGCACACTGTGCAGAGTCAGGACCGTGTG\nCTCAAGGAGCTGTTTGGTCATTTGAGCAAGTTGTTGGGCTGTAAGCAGAAGATTATTGAT\nCTACTCCCTAAGGTGGAAGTGGCCCTCAGTAATATCAAAGAAGCTGACAATACTGTCATG\nTTCATGCAGGGAAAAAGGCAGAAAGAAATATGGCATCTCCTTAAAATTGCCTGTACACAG\nAGTTCTGCCCGGTCCCTTGTAGGATCCAGTCTAGAAGGTGCAGTAACCCCTCAGACATCA\nGCATGGCTGCCCCCGACTTCAGCAGAACATGATCATTCTCTGTCATGTGTGGTAACTCCT\nCAAGATGGGGAGACTTCAGCACAAATGATAGAAGAAAATTTGAACTGCCTTGGCCATTTA\nAGCACTATTATTCATGAGGCAAATGAGGAACAGGGCAATAGTATGATGAATCTTGATTGG\nAGTTGGTTAACAGAATGA'),('Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta','None','Human','Scaffold protein binding','Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses.

Has antimicrobial activity, which depends on the extracellular cation concentration. Antimicrobial properties include bacteriostasis, which is related to its ability to sequester free iron and thus inhibit microbial growth, as well as direct bactericidal properties leading to the release of lipopolysaccharides from the bacterial outer membrane. Can also prevent bacterial biofilm development in P.aeruginosa infection. Has weak antifungal activity against C.albicans. Has anabolic, differentiating and anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts and can also inhibit osteoclastogenesis, possibly playing a role in the regulation of bone growth. Promotes binding of species C adenoviruses to epithelial cells, promoting adenovirus infection. Can inhibit papillomavirus infections. Stimulates the TLR4 signaling pathway leading to NF-kappa-B activation and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production while also interfering with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TLR4 signaling. Inhibits neutrophil granulocyte migration to sites of apoptosis, when secreted by apoptotic cells. Stimulates VEGFA-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Binds heparin, chondroitin sulfate and possibly other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Also binds specifically to pneumococcal surface protein A (pspA), the lipid A portion of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysozyme and DNA.Lactoferricin binds to the bacterial surface and is crucial for the bactericidal functions. Has some antiviral activity against papillomavirus infection. N-terminal region shows strong antifungal activity against C.albicans. Contains two BBXB heparin-binding consensus sequences that appear to form the predominate functional GAG-binding site.Kaliocin-1 has antimicrobial activity and is able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes.Lactoferroxins A, B and C have opioid antagonist activity. Lactoferroxin A shows preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C have somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors.The lactotransferrin transferrin-like domain 1 functions as a serine protease of the peptidase S60 family that cuts arginine rich regions.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.','MAPK3','43135.16','DB00605','>lcl|BSEQ0021655|Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3)\nATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCTCAGGGGGGCGGGGGCGGGGAGCCCCGTAGAACCGAGGGGGTC\nGGCCCGGGGGTCCCGGGGGAGGTGGAGATGGTGAAGGGGCAGCCGTTCGACGTGGGCCCG\nCGCTACACGCAGTTGCAGTACATCGGCGAGGGCGCGTACGGCATGGTCAGCTCGGCCTAT\nGACCACGTGCGCAAGACTCGCGTGGCCATCAAGAAGATCAGCCCCTTCGAACATCAGACC\nTACTGCCAGCGCACGCTCCGGGAGATCCAGATCCTGCTGCGCTTCCGCCATGAGAATGTC\nATCGGCATCCGAGACATTCTGCGGGCGTCCACCCTGGAAGCCATGAGAGATGTCTACATT\nGTGCAGGACCTGATGGAGACTGACCTGTACAAGTTGCTGAAAAGCCAGCAGCTGAGCAAT\nGACCATATCTGCTACTTCCTCTACCAGATCCTGCGGGGCCTCAAGTACATCCACTCCGCC\nAACGTGCTCCACCGAGATCTAAAGCCCTCCAACCTGCTCATCAACACCACCTGCGACCTT\nAAGATTTGTGATTTCGGCCTGGCCCGGATTGCCGATCCTGAGCATGACCACACCGGCTTC\nCTGACGGAGTATGTGGCTACGCGCTGGTACCGGGCCCCAGAGATCATGCTGAACTCCAAG\nGGCTATACCAAGTCCATCGACATCTGGTCTGTGGGCTGCATTCTGGCTGAGATGCTCTCT\nAACCGGCCCATCTTCCCTGGCAAGCACTACCTGGATCAGCTCAACCACATTCTGGGCATC\nCTGGGCTCCCCATCCCAGGAGGACCTGAATTGTATCATCAACATGAAGGCCCGAAACTAC\nCTACAGTCTCTGCCCTCCAAGACCAAGGTGGCTTGGGCCAAGCTTTTCCCCAAGTCAGAC\nTCCAAAGCCCTTGACCTGCTGGACCGGATGTTAACCTTTAACCCCAATAAACGGATCACA\nGTGGAGGAAGCGCTGGCTCACCCCTACCTGGAGCAGTACTATGACCCGACGGATGAGGTG\nGGCCAGTCCCCAGCAGCAGTGGGGCTGGGGGCAGGGGAGCAGGGGGGCACGTAG'),('Mu-type opioid receptor','None','Human','Voltage-gated calcium channel activity','Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl, etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins, GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2, and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase (PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins. The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation. Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects. Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1 isoforms and reduce their ligand binding

Can modulate chromatin function through deacetylation of histones and can promote alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to transcriptional repression. Deacetylates a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression positively and negatively. Serves as a sensor of the cytosolic ratio of NAD(+)/NADH which is altered by glucose deprivation and metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction. Is essential in skeletal muscle cell differentiation and in response to low nutrients mediates the inhibitory effect on skeletal myoblast differentiation which also involves 5\'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at \'Lys-9\' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Deacetylates \'Lys-266\' of SUV39H1, leading to its activation. Inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation by deacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. Deacetylates H2A and \'Lys-26\' of HIST1H1E. Deacetylates \'Lys-16\' of histone H4 (in vitro). Involved in NR0B2/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling: Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2/SHP thereby stimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading to transcriptional repression. Proposed to contribute to genomic integrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however, reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin are conflicting. Proposed to play a role in constitutive heterochromatin (CH) formation and/or maintenance through regulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1. Upon oxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2. This increase in SUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turn seems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin which correlates with greater genomic integrity during stress response. Deacetylates \'Lys-382\' of p53/TP53 and impairs its ability to induce transcription-dependent proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNA transcription by the RNA polymerase I. Deacetylates MYC, promotes the association of MYC with MAX and decreases MYC stability leading to compromised transformational capability. Deacetylates FOXO3 in response to oxidative stress thereby increasing its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibiting FOXO3-mediated induction of apoptosis transcriptional activity; also leading to FOXO3 ubiquitination and protesomal degradation. Appears to have a similar effect on MLLT7/FOXO4 in regulation of transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Deacetylates DNMT1; thereby impairs DNMT1 methyltransferase-independent transcription repressor activity, modulates DNMT1 cell cycle regulatory function and DNMT1-mediated gene silencing. Deacetylates RELA/NF-kappa-B p65 thereby inhibiting its transactivating potential and augments apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Deacetylates HIF1A, KAT5/TIP60, RB1 and HIC1. Deacetylates FOXO1 resulting in its nuclear retention and enhancement of its transcriptional activity leading to increased gluconeogenesis in liver. Inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function, possibly by deacetylation. Involved in HES1- and HEY2-mediated transcriptional repression. In cooperation with MYCN seems to be involved in transcriptional repression of DUSP6/MAPK3 leading to MYCN stabilization by phosphorylation at \'Ser-62\'. Deacetylates MEF2D. Required for antagonist-mediated transcription suppression of AR-dependent genes which may be linked to local deacetylation of histone H3. Represses HNF1A-mediated transcription. Required for the repression of ESRRG by CREBZF. Modulates AP-1 transcription factor activity. Deacetylates NR1H3 AND NR1H2 and deacetylation of NR1H3 at \'Lys-434\' positively regulates transcription of NR1H3:RXR target genes, promotes NR1H3 proteosomal degradation and results in cholesterol efflux; a promoter clearing mechanism after reach round of transcription is proposed. Involved in lipid metabolism. Implicated in regulation of adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1 and SMRT/NCOR2. Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, and HMGCS1. Involved in liver and muscle metabolism. Through deacteylation and activation of PPARGC1A is required to activate fatty acid oxidation in skeletel muscle under low-glucose conditions and is involved in glucose homeostasis. Involved in regulation of PPARA and fatty acid beta-oxidation in liver. Involved in positive regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose; the function seems to imply transcriptional repression of UCP2. Proposed to deacetylate IRS2 thereby facilitating its insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Deacetylates SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C thereby decreasing its stability and transactivation in lipogenic gene expression. Involved in DNA damage response by repressing genes which are involved in DNA repair, such as XPC and TP73, deacetylating XRCC6/Ku70, and faciliting recruitment of additional factors to sites of damaged DNA, such as SIRT1-deacetylated NBN can recruit ATM to initiate DNA repair and SIRT1-deacetylated XPA interacts with RPA2. Also involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and specifically single-strand annealing independently of XRCC6/Ku70 and NBN. Transcriptional suppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressor complex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptional suppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. Deacetylates WRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities and regulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage. Deacetylates APEX1 at \'Lys-6\' and \'Lys-7\' and stimulates cellular AP endonuclease activity by promoting the association of APEX1 to XRCC1. Increases p53/TP53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. Deacetylates XRCC6/Ku70 at \'Lys-539\' and \'Lys-542\' causing it to sequester BAX away from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptosis. Is involved in autophagy, presumably by deacetylating ATG5, ATG7 and MAP1LC3B/ATG8. Deacetylates AKT1 which leads to enhanced binding of AKT1 and PDK1 to PIP3 and promotes their activation. Proposed to play role in regulation of STK11/LBK1-dependent AMPK signaling pathways implicated in cellular senescence which seems to involve the regulation of the acetylation status of STK11/LBK1. Can deacetylate STK11/LBK1 and thereby increase its activity, cytoplasmic localization and association with STRAD; however, the relevance of such activity in normal cells is unclear. In endothelial cells is shown to inhibit STK11/LBK1 activity and to promote its degradation. Deacetylates SMAD7 at \'Lys-64\' and \'Lys-70\' thereby promoting its degradation. Deacetylates CIITA and augments its MHC class II transactivation and contributes to its stability. Deacteylates MECOM/EVI1. Isoform 2 is shown to deacetylate \'Lys-382\' of p53/TP53, however with lower activity than isoform 1. In combination, the two isoforms exert an additive effect. Isoform 2 regulates p53/TP53 expression and cellular stress response and is in turn repressed by p53/TP53 presenting a SIRT1 isoform-dependent auto-regulatory loop. In case of HIV-1 infection, interacts with and deacetylates the viral Tat protein. The viral Tat protein inhibits SIRT1 deacetylation activity toward RELA/NF-kappa-B p65, thereby potentiates its transcriptional activity and SIRT1 is proposed to contribute to T-cell hyperactivation during infection. Deacetylates PML at \'Lys-487\' and this deacetylation promotes PML control of PER2 nuclear localization. During the neurogenic transition, repress selective NOTCH1-target genes through histone deacetylation in a BCL6-dependent manner and leading to neuronal differentiation. Regulates the circadian expression of several core clock genes, including ARNTL/BMAL1, RORC, PER2 and CRY1 and plays a critical role in maintaining a controlled rhythmicity in histone acetylation, thereby contributing to circadian chromatin remodeling.

Binds numerous imidazoline ligands that induces initiation of cell-signaling cascades triggering to cell survival, growth and migration. Its activation by the agonist rilmenidine induces an increase in phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1 and MAPK3 in rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons that exhibited rilmenidine-evoked hypotension (By similarity). Blocking its activation with efaroxan abolished rilmenidine-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in RVLM neurons (By similarity). Acts as a modulator of Rac-regulated signal transduction pathways (By similarity). Suppresses Rac1-stimulated cell migration by interacting with PAK1 and inhibiting its kinase activity (By similarity). Also blocks Pak-independent Rac signaling by interacting with RAC1 and inhibiting Rac1-stimulated NF-kB response element and cyclin D1 promoter activation (By similarity). Inhibits also LIMK1 kinase activity by reducing LIMK1 \'Tyr-508\' phosphorylation (By similarity). Inhibits Rac-induced cell migration and invasion in breast and colon epithelial cells (By similarity). Inhibits lamellipodia formation, when overexpressed (By similarity). Plays a role in protection against apoptosis. Involved in association with IRS4 in the enhancement of insulin activation of MAPK1 and MAPK3. When overexpressed, induces a redistribution of cell surface ITGA5 integrin to intracellular endosomal structures.','NISCH','166627.105','DB00697','>lcl|BSEQ0021702|Nischarin (NISCH)\nATGGCGACCGCGCGCACCTTCGGGCCCGAGCGGGAAGCCGAGCCGGCCAAGGAAGCGCGC\nGTCGTGGGCTCGGAGCTTGTGGACACTTATACGGTTTACATCATCCAGGTCACTGATGGC\nAGCCATGAGTGGACAGTAAAGCACCGCTACAGCGACTTCCATGACCTGCATGAAAAGCTC\nGTTGCAGAGAGAAAGATTGATAAAAATCTGCTTCCGCCCAAAAAGATAATTGGGAAAAAC\nTCAAGAAGCTTGGTGGAGAAGAGGGAGAAGGATCTGGAGGTCTACCTCCAGAAGCTCCTG\nGCTGCCTTCCCTGGCGTGACCCCCAGAGTACTGGCCCACTTCTTGCATTTTCACTTCTAT\nGAGATAAATGGCATCACCGCGGCACTGGCTGAAGAGCTCTTTGAGAAAGGAGAACAGCTC\nCTGGGGGCCGGCGAGGTCTTTGCCATTGGACCCCTGCAGCTGTATGCCGTCACGGAGCAG\nCTGCAGCAGGGAAAGCCCACGTGCGCCAGTGGGGATGCCAAGACCGACCTCGGGCACATC\nCTGGACTTCACCTGTCGCCTTAAGTACCTTAAGGTTTCTGGCACAGAAGGACCTTTTGGG\nACCAGCAACATTCAGGAGCAGCTCCTGCCGTTCGACCTATCAATATTCAAGTCCCTGCAT\nCAGGTGGAGATAAGTCACTGTGATGCTAAGCACATCAGAGGGCTGGTCGCATCGAAGCCC\nACCTTAGCCACGCTGAGTGTCCGCTTCTCAGCAACCTCGATGAAGGAAGTCCTTGTTCCT\nGAAGCCTCAGAATTTGATGAGTGGGAGCCTGAAGGCACAACCCTAGAAGGCCCTGTGACT\nGCCGTCATCCCCACTTGGCAGGCATTGACCACGCTTGACCTGAGCCACAACAGCATCTCC\nGAGATCGACGAGTCTGTGAAACTGATCCCAAAGATTGAGTTCCTGGACCTGAGTCACAAT\nGGATTGCTGGTTGTGGACAATCTGCAGCACCTGTATAACCTTGTGCATCTGGACCTGTCC\nTACAACAAGCTCTCCTCCTTGGAAGGGCTTCACACCAAGCTGGGGAACATCAAGACCTTA\nAACCTGGCAGGCAACCTCCTAGAGAGTCTGAGTGGCCTGCACAAGCTCTACTCACTGGTC\nAACCTGGATCTCCGGGACAACAGGATCGAACAGATGGAGGAGGTCCGGAGCATAGGCAGC\nCTCCCGTGTCTGGAGCACGTGTCTCTGCTGAACAACCCTCTGAGCATCATCCCCGACTAC\nCGGACCAAGGTGCTGGCTCAGTTCGGAGAGAGGGCCTCAGAGGTCTGTCTGGATGACACA\nGTGACCACAGAGAAGGAGCTGGACACTGTGGAAGTGCTGAAAGCAATTCAGAAAGCCAAG\nGAGGTCAAGTCCAAACTGAGCAACCCAGAGAAGAAGGGTGGTGAAGACTCCCGGCTCTCA\nGCTGCCCCCTGCATCAGACCCAGCAGCTCCCCTCCCACTGTGGCTCCCGCATCTGCCTCC\nCTGCCCCAGCCCATCCTCTCTAACCAAGGTAATCGTGTATGTATCTTGCTTCTAGTGGAG\nCCACACAGCCCTGCCTGGGCCCCCTGGCTGGGCTGGGGTTGGGGGAGAGGTGCCAGCACC\nTGCTTCCAACAGGGTCAGACACAGGGAGGGCAGTGCCTTCTGCAGGCTGGTCCTCGCGGG\nGGGACACATGGCAGGGGTGCCTGGCCTGATGCCAGCTGTTGCTTGCTTGGTGAGGACTCC\nCAATTGCTCTGA'),('Nitric oxide synthase, brain','None','Human','Tetrahydrobiopterin binding','Produces nitric oxide (NO) which is a messenger molecule with diverse functions throughout the body.

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. In a non-canonical activation pathway, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p52 complex is a transcriptional activator. The NF-kappa-B p52-p52 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor. NFKB2 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p100 and generation of p52 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p52 and p100 and preserves their independent function. p52 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5\'-GGRNNYYCC-3\', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. p52 and p100 are respectively the minor and major form; the processing of p100 being relatively poor. Isoform p49 is a subunit of the NF-kappa-B protein complex, which stimulates the HIV enhancer in synergy with p65.

In a complex with MAP3K8, NFKB1/p105 represses MAP3K8-induced MAPK signaling; active MAP3K8 is released by proteasome-dependent degradation of NFKB1/p105.','NFKB1','105355.175','DB05767','>lcl|BSEQ0019061|Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p105 subunit (NFKB1)\nATGGCAGAAGATGATCCATATTTGGGAAGGCCTGAACAAATGTTTCATTTGGATCCTTCT\nTTGACTCATACAATATTTAATCCAGAAGTATTTCAACCACAGATGGCACTGCCAACAGAT\nGGCCCATACCTTCAAATATTAGAGCAACCTAAACAGAGAGGATTTCGTTTCCGTTATGTA\nTGTGAAGGCCCATCCCATGGTGGACTACCTGGTGCCTCTAGTGAAAAGAACAAGAAGTCT\nTACCCTCAGGTCAAAATCTGCAACTATGTGGGACCAGCAAAGGTTATTGTTCAGTTGGTC\nACAAATGGAAAAAATATCCACCTGCATGCCCACAGCCTGGTGGGAAAACACTGTGAGGAT\nGGGATCTGCACTGTAACTGCTGGACCCAAGGACATGGTGGTCGGCTTCGCAAACCTGGGT\nATACTTCATGTGACAAAGAAAAAAGTATTTGAAACACTGGAAGCACGAATGACAGAGGCG\nTGTATAAGGGGCTATAATCCTGGACTCTTGGTGCACCCTGACCTTGCCTATTTGCAAGCA\nGAAGGTGGAGGGGACCGGCAGCTGGGAGATCGGGAAAAAGAGCTAATCCGCCAAGCAGCT\nCTGCAGCAGACCAAGGAGATGGACCTCAGCGTGGTGCGGCTCATGTTTACAGCTTTTCTT\nCCGGATAGCACTGGCAGCTTCACAAGGCGCCTGGAACCCGTGGTATCAGACGCCATCTAT\nGACAGTAAAGCCCCCAATGCATCCAACTTGAAAATTGTAAGAATGGACAGGACAGCTGGA\nTGTGTGACTGGAGGGGAGGAAATTTATCTTCTTTGTGACAAAGTTCAGAAAGATGACATC\nCAGATTCGATTTTATGAAGAGGAAGAAAATGGTGGAGTCTGGGAAGGATTTGGAGATTTT\nTCCCCCACAGATGTTCATAGACAATTTGCCATTGTCTTCAAAACTCCAAAGTATAAAGAT\nATTAATATTACAAAACCAGCCTCTGTGTTTGTCCAGCTTCGGAGGAAATCTGACTTGGAA\nACTAGTGAACCAAAACCTTTCCTCTACTATCCTGAAATCAAAGATAAAGAAGAAGTGCAG\nAGGAAACGTCAGAAGCTCATGCCCAATTTTTCGGATAGTTTCGGCGGTGGTAGTGGTGCT\nGGAGCTGGAGGCGGAGGCATGTTTGGTAGTGGCGGTGGAGGAGGGGGCACTGGAAGTACA\nGGTCCAGGGTATAGCTTCCCACACTATGGATTTCCTACTTATGGTGGGATTACTTTCCAT\nCCTGGAACTACTAAATCTAATGCTGGGATGAAGCATGGAACCATGGACACTGAATCTAAA\nAAGGACCCTGAAGGTTGTGACAAAAGTGATGACAAAAACACTGTAAACCTCTTTGGGAAA\nGTTATTGAAACCACAGAGCAAGATCAGGAGCCCAGCGAGGCCACCGTTGGGAATGGTGAG\nGTCACTCTAACGTATGCAACAGGAACAAAAGAAGAGAGTGCTGGAGTTCAGGATAACCTC\nTTTCTAGAGAAGGCTATGCAGCTTGCAAAGAGGCATGCCAATGCCCTTTTCGACTACGCG\nGTGACAGGAGACGTGAAGATGCTGCTGGCCGTCCAGCGCCATCTCACTGCTGTGCAGGAT\nGAGAATGGGGACAGTGTCTTACACTTAGCAATCATCCACCTTCATTCTCAACTTGTGAGG\nGATCTACTAGAAGTCACATCTGGTTTGATTTCTGATGACATTATCAACATGAGAAATGAT\nCTGTACCAGACGCCCTTGCACTTGGCAGTGATCACTAAGCAGGAAGATGTGGTGGAGGAT\nTTGCTGAGGGCTGGGGCCGACCTGAGCCTTCTGGACCGCTTGGGTAACTCTGTTTTGCAC\nCTAGCTGCCAAAGAAGGACATGATAAAGTTCTCAGTATCTTACTCAAGCACAAAAAGGCA\nGCACTACTTCTTGACCACCCCAACGGGGACGGTCTGAATGCCATTCATCTAGCCATGATG\nAGCAATAGCCTGCCATGTTTGCTGCTGCTGGTGGCCGCTGGGGCTGACGTCAATGCTCAG\nGAGCAGAAGTCCGGGCGCACAGCACTGCACCTGGCTGTGGAGCACGACAACATCTCATTG\nGCAGGCTGCCTGCTCCTGGAGGGTGATGCCCATGTGGACAGTACTACCTACGATGGAACC\nACACCCCTGCATATAGCAGCTGGGAGAGGGTCCACCAGGCTGGCAGCTCTTCTCAAAGCA\nGCAGGAGCAGATCCCCTGGTGGAGAACTTTGAGCCTCTCTATGACCTGGATGACTCTTGG\nGAAAATGCAGGAGAGGATGAAGGAGTTGTGCCTGGAACCACGCCTCTAGATATGGCCACC\nAGCTGGCAGGTATTTGACATATTAAATGGGAAACCATATGAGCCAGAGTTTACATCTGAT\nGATTTACTAGCACAAGGAGACATGAAACAGCTGGCTGAAGATGTGAAGCTGCAGCTGTAT\nAAGTTACTAGAAATTCCTGATCCAGACAAAAACTGGGCTACTCTGGCGCAGAAATTAGGT\nCTGGGGATACTTAATAATGCCTTCCGGCTGAGTCCTGCTCCTTCCAAAACACTTATGGAC\nAACTATGAGGTCTCTGGGGGTACAGTCAGAGAGCTGGTGGAGGCCCTGAGACAAATGGGC\nTACACCGAAGCAATTGAAGTGATCCAGGCAGCCTCCAGCCCAGTGAAGACCACCTCTCAG\nGCCCACTCGCTGCCTCTCTCGCCTGCCTCCACAAGGCAGCAAATAGACGAGCTCCGAGAC\nAGTGACAGTGTCTGCGACAGCGGCGTGGAGACATCCTTCCGCAAACTCAGCTTTACCGAG\nTCTCTGACCAGTGGTGCCTCACTGCTAACTCTCAACAAAATGCCCCATGATTATGGGCAG\nGAAGGACCTCTAGAAGGCAAAATTTAG'),('Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2','None','Human','Zinc ion binding','Nuclear receptor that binds and is activated by variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds.

Forms tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:19912772). Can form functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5, KCNA6, KCNA7, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368). Channel properties are modulated by cytoplasmic beta subunits that regulate the subcellular location of the alpha subunits and promote rapid inactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368). In vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign currents observed in intact tissues to any particular potassium channel family member. Homotetrameric KCNA1 forms a delayed-rectifier potassium channel that opens in response to membrane depolarization, followed by slow spontaneous channel closure (PubMed:19912772, PubMed:19968958, PubMed:19307729, PubMed:19903818). In contrast, a heterotetrameric channel formed by KCNA1 and KCNA4 shows rapid inactivation (PubMed:17156368). Regulates neuronal excitability in hippocampus, especially in mossy fibers and medial perforant path axons, preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. Response to toxins that are selective for KCNA1, respectively for KCNA2, suggests that heteromeric potassium channels composed of both KCNA1 and KCNA2 play a role in pacemaking and regulate the output of deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (By similarity). May function as down-stream effector for G protein-coupled receptors and inhibit GABAergic inputs to basolateral amygdala neurons (By similarity). May contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating the generation of action potentials and preventing hyperexcitability in myelinated axons of the vagus nerve, and thereby contributes to the regulation of heart contraction (By similarity). Required for normal neuromuscular responses (PubMed:11026449, PubMed:17136396). Regulates the frequency of neuronal action potential firing in response to mechanical stimuli, and plays a role in the perception of pain caused by mechanical stimuli, but does not play a role in the perception of pain due to heat stimuli (By similarity). Required for normal responses to auditory stimuli and precise location of sound sources, but not for sound perception (By similarity). The use of toxins that block specific channels suggest that it contributes to the regulation of the axonal release of the neurotransmitter dopamine (By similarity). Required for normal postnatal brain development and normal proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in the brain (By similarity). Plays a role in the reabsorption of Mg(2+) in the distal convoluted tubules in the kidney and in magnesium ion homeostasis, probably via its effect on the membrane potential (PubMed:23903368, PubMed:19307729).','KCNA1','56465.01','DB01028','>lcl|BSEQ0019012|Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 (KCNA1)\nATGACGGTGATGTCTGGGGAGAACGTGGACGAGGCTTCGGCCGCCCCGGGCCACCCCCAG\nGATGGCAGCTACCCCCGGCAGGCCGACCACGACGACCACGAGTGCTGCGAGCGCGTGGTG\nATCAACATCTCCGGGCTGCGCTTCGAGACGCAGCTCAAGACCCTGGCGCAGTTCCCCAAC\nACGCTGCTGGGCAACCCTAAGAAACGCATGCGCTACTTCGACCCCCTGAGGAACGAGTAC\nTTCTTCGACCGCAACCGGCCCAGCTTCGACGCCATCCTCTACTACTACCAGTCCGGCGGC\nCGCCTGCGGAGGCCGGTCAACGTGCCCCTGGACATGTTCTCCGAGGAGATCAAGTTTTAC\nGAGTTGGGCGAGGAGGCCATGGAGAAGTTCCGGGAGGACGAGGGCTTCATCAAGGAGGAG\nGAGCGCCCTCTGCCCGAGAAGGAGTACCAGCGCCAGGTGTGGCTGCTCTTCGAGTACCCC\nGAGAGCTCGGGGCCCGCCAGGGTCATCGCCATCGTCTCCGTCATGGTCATCCTCATCTCC\nATCGTCATCTTTTGCCTGGAGACGCTCCCCGAGCTGAAGGATGACAAGGACTTCACGGGC\nACCGTCCACCGCATCGACAACACCACGGTCATCTACAATTCCAACATCTTCACAGACCCC\nTTCTTCATCGTGGAAACGCTGTGTATCATCTGGTTCTCCTTCGAGCTGGTGGTGCGCTTC\nTTCGCCTGCCCCAGCAAGACGGACTTCTTCAAAAACATCATGAACTTCATAGACATTGTG\nGCCATCATTCCTTATTTCATCACGCTGGGCACCGAGATAGCTGAGCAGGAAGGAAACCAG\nAAGGGCGAGCAGGCCACCTCCCTGGCCATCCTCAGGGTCATCCGCTTGGTAAGGGTTTTT\nAGAATCTTCAAGCTCTCCCGCCACTCTAAGGGCCTCCAGATCCTGGGCCAGACCCTCAAA\nGCTAGTATGAGAGAGCTAGGGCTGCTCATCTTTTTCCTCTTCATCGGGGTCATCCTGTTT\nTCTAGTGCAGTGTACTTTGCCGAGGCGGAAGAAGCTGAGTCGCACTTCTCCAGTATCCCC\nGATGCTTTCTGGTGGGCGGTGGTGTCCATGACCACTGTAGGATACGGTGACATGTACCCT\nGTGACAATTGGAGGCAAGATCGTGGGCTCCTTGTGTGCCATCGCTGGTGTGCTAACAATT\nGCCCTGCCCGTACCTGTCATTGTGTCCAATTTCAACTATTTCTACCACCGAGAAACTGAG\nGGGGAAGAGCAGGCTCAGTTGCTCCACGTCAGTTCCCCTAACTTAGCCTCTGACAGTGAC\nCTCAGTCGCCGCAGTTCCTCTACTATGAGCAAGTCTGAGTACATGGAGATCGAAGAGGAT\nATGAATAATAGCATAGCCCATTATAGACAGGTCAATATCAGAACTGCCAATTGCACCACT\nGCTAACCAAAACTGCGTTAATAAGAGCAAGCTACTGACCGATGTTTAA'),('Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2','None','Human','Voltage-gated potassium channel activity','Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain.

Interaction with specific isoforms of the regulatory subunits KCNIP1, KCNIP2, KCNIP3 or KCNIP4 strongly increases expression at the cell surface and thereby increases channel activity; it modulates the kinetics of channel activation and inactivation, shifts the threshold for channel activation to more negative voltage values, shifts the threshold for inactivation to less negative voltages and accelerates recovery after inactivation (PubMed:15454437, PubMed:14623880, PubMed:14980201, PubMed:19171772, PubMed:24501278, PubMed:24811166). Likewise, interaction with DPP6 or DPP10 promotes expression at the cell membrane and regulates both channel characteristics and activity (By similarity).','KCND2','70535.825','DB00321','>lcl|BSEQ0019444|Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2 (KCND2)\nATGGCGGCGGGGGTGGCAGCGTGGCTGCCTTTTGCAAGGGCAGCGGCTATCGGGTGGATG\nCCTGTGGCCTCGGGGCCTATGCCGGCTCCCCCGAGGCAGGAGAGGAAAAGGACCCAAGAT\nGCTCTCATTGTGCTGAATGTGAGTGGCACCCGCTTCCAGACGTGGCAGGACACCCTGGAA\nCGTTACCCAGACACTCTACTGGGCAGTTCTGAGAGGGACTTTTTCTACCACCCAGAAACT\nCAGCAGTATTTCTTTGACCGTGACCCAGACATCTTCCGCCACATCCTGAATTTCTACCGC\nACTGGGAAGCTCCACTATCCTCGCCACGAGTGCATCTCTGCTTACGATGAAGAACTGGCC\nTTCTTTGGCCTCATCCCGGAAATCATCGGCGACTGCTGTTATGAGGAGTACAAGGATCGC\nAGGCGAGAGAACGCCGAGCGCCTGCAGGACGACGCGGATACCGACACCGCTGGGGAGAGC\nGCCTTGCCCACCATGACTGCAAGGCAGAGGGTCTGGAGGGCCTTCGAGAACCCCCACACC\nAGCACGATGGCCCTGGTGTTCTACTATGTCACGGGGTTTTTCATTGCCGTCTCTGTCATC\nGCGAATGTGGTGGAAACAGTGCCGTGCGGATCAAGCCCAGGTCACATTAAAGAACTGCCC\nTGTGGAGAGCGGTATGCTGTGGCCTTCTTCTGCTTGGACACGGCCTGCGTCATGATCTTC\nACAGTTGAGTATTTGCTTCGCCTGGCTGCAGCGCCTAGTCGTTACCGTTTTGTGCGTAGT\nGTCATGAGTATCATCGACGTGGTGGCCATCCTGCCTTATTACATTGGGCTGGTGATGACA\nGACAATGAGGACGTCAGCGGAGCCTTTGTCACACTCCGAGTCTTCCGGGTCTTCAGGATC\nTTTAAGTTTTCCCGCCACTCTCAAGGCCTGCGCATCCTGGGGTACACACTGAAGAGTTGT\nGCCTCAGAATTGGGCTTCTTGCTTTTCTCGCTCACCATGGCTATCATCATCTTCGCTACA\nGTTATGTTCTACGCAGAGAAGGGGTCTTCGGCTAGCAAGTTCACCAGCATCCCTGCAGCC\nTTCTGGTATACCATCGTCACCATGACAACACTAGGGTATGGTGACATGGTGCCAAAAACC\nATAGCAGGGAAGATTTTTGGTTCTATCTGTTCGCTGAGTGGGGTCTTGGTCATTGCTCTA\nCCTGTTCCGGTGATTGTATCCAACTTCAGTCGCATCTACCACCAGAATCAACGAGCAGAC\nAAACGAAGGGCACAAAAGAAAGCTAGACTGGCCAGGATCCGGGCAGCCAAAAGCGGAAGC\nGCAAATGCTTACATGCAGAGCAAACGGAATGGTTTACTCAGTAATCAGCTGCAGTCCTCA\nGAGGATGAGCAGGCTTTTGTTAGCAAATCCGGCTCCAGCTTTGAAACCCAGCACCACCAC\nCTGCTTCACTGCCTGGAAAAAACCACGAATCACGAGTTTGTGGACGAACAAGTCTTTGAA\nGAAAGCTGCATGGAAGTTGCAACTGTTAATCGTCCTTCAAGTCACAGTCCTTCACTGTCT\nTCACAACAAGGAGTCACCAGCACCTGCTGTTCACGACGACACAAAAAAACTTTTCGCATC\nCCAAATGCCAATGTATCAGGAAGCCATCAAGGTAGTATACAAGAACTCAGCACGATTCAG\nATCAGATGTGTGGAGAGAACACCTCTGTCTAACAGCCGATCCAGTTTAAATGCCAAAATG\nGAAGAGTGTGTTAAACTAAACTGTGAACAACCTTATGTGACTACAGCAATAATAAGCATC\nCCAACACCTCCAGTAACCACACCAGAAGGAGACGATAGGCCAGAATCCCCTGAGTACTCA\nGGAGGAAATATTGTCAGAGTTTCTGCTTTGTAA'),('Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3','None','Human','Metal ion binding','Pore-forming (alpha) subunit of voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type potassium channels.

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported. AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface. Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at \'Ser-50\' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at \'Ser-21\' and GSK3B at \'Ser-9\', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity. Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven. AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase). Phosphorylation of \'Ser-83\' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at \'Ser-939\' and \'Thr-1462\', thereby activating mTORC1 signaling and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1. AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization. In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at \'Thr-24\', \'Ser-256\' and \'Ser-319\'. FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites. AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1. AKT phosphorylates \'Ser-454\' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis. Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of \'Ser-273\', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis. Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on \'Ser-318\', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity. The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I. Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly. May be involved in the regulation of the placental development. Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at \'Thr-120\' and \'Thr-387\' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3. Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at \'Thr-117\' and \'Thr-384\' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates RAF1 at \'Ser-259\' and negatively regulates its activity. Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity. Phosphorylates KAT6A at \'Thr-369\' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53.AKT1-specific substrates have been recently identified, including palladin (PALLD), which phosphorylation modulates cytoskeletal organization and cell motility; prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation; and CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at \'Thr-145\' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization. These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation.

Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes.

In the absence of ligand, the RXR-RAR heterodimers associate with a multiprotein complex containing transcription corepressors that induce histone acetylation, chromatin condensation and transcriptional suppression. On ligand binding, the corepressors dissociate from the receptors and associate with the coactivators leading to transcriptional activation. RARA plays an essential role in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced germ cell development during spermatogenesis.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2). Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4. Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex. Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor. In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1. To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A. mTORC1 also negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1. Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at \'Ser-758\', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1. Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP. mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor. Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules. As part of the mTORC2 complex MTOR may regulate other cellular processes including survival and organization of the cytoskeleton.

This receptor is coupled via pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In addition it stimulates phosphotyrosine phosphatase and PLC via pertussis toxin insensitive as well as sensitive G proteins. Inhibits calcium entry by suppressing voltage-dependent calcium channels. Acts as the functionally dominant somatostatin receptor in pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells where it mediates the inhibitory effect of somatostatin-14 on hormone secretion. Inhibits cell growth through enhancement of MAPK1 and MAPK2 phosphorylation and subsequent up-regulation of CDKN1B.

Activated by icilin, eucalyptol, menthol, cold and modulation of intracellular pH. Involved in menthol sensation. Permeable for monovalent cations sodium, potassium, and cesium and divalent cation calcium. Temperature sensing is tightly linked to voltage-dependent gating. Activated upon depolarization, changes in temperature resulting in graded shifts of its voltage-dependent activation curves. The chemical agonist menthol functions as a gating modifier, shifting activation curves towards physiological membrane potentials. Temperature sensitivity arises from a tenfold difference in the activation energies associated with voltage-dependent opening and closing. In prostate cancer cells, shows strong inward rectification and high calcium selectivity in contrast to its behavior in normal cells which is characterized by outward rectification and poor cationic selectivity. Plays a role in prostate cancer cell migration (PubMed:25559186).

The two main forms are squamous-cell carcinoma (ECSC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC). ECSC is the most frequent histological subtype in esophageal cancer, although the incidence of EAC is increasing faster than any other malignancy in the western world. Whereas ESCC can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the most important risk factor for the development of EAC is duodenal-gastric-esophageal reflux.

Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These alterations have been described in both HPV-positive and -negative penile cancers.','Cancer','hsa05203','https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05203','H00025.png','Viral carcinogenesis'),('https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ds:H00046','H00046','Cholangiocarcinoma','Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm that carries a poor prognosis and lacks effective therapy.

The tumor arises from the ductular epithelium of the biliary tree, either within the liver (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: ICC) or more commonly from the extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Several studies have demonstrated mutations resulting in overexpression of K-ras and p53 genes. These genetic alterations are associated with a more aggressive phenotype in this cancer.

The majority of FHM families have a mutation in one of the ion channels CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A. SHM is sometimes caused by a de novo mutation in one of the genes. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified.','Nervous system disease','hsa04010','https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa04010+773','H00775.png','MAPK signaling pathway'),('https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ds:H00783','H00783','Febrile seizures','Febrile seizures (FS), or febrile convulsions (FEB), are acute symptomatic seizures that occur in response to fever and represent the most common form of childhood seizures.

Furthermore, mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel subunit genes (SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN1B) and the GABA(A) receptor subunit genes (GABRG2 and GABRD) have been identified in GEFS+.','Nervous system disease','hsa04728','https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa04728+6323','H00783.png','Dopaminergic synapse'),('https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ds:H01611','H01611','Alcohol dependence','Alcohol dependence (AD) is a chronic but often disease that includes problems in controlling one\'s drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol, continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems, having to drink more to get the same effect (physical dependence), or having withdrawal symptoms when one rapidly decreases or stops drinking. The contribution of genetic factors to the development of AD is high. The best classical candidate genes for AD are alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Both genes are involved in enzymatic degradation of alcohol. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that the most robust associations for AD have been with such enzyme genes, especially ALDH2 in East Asian populations and ADH1B in European American and African American populations.','Mental and behavioural disorder','hsa05034','https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05034+1813','H01611.png',''),('https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ds:H01815','H01815','Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy','Malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy (MMPSI) are rare, severe early infantile onset epileptic encephalopathy. The common clinical features are seizure onset within the first 6 months of life, occurrence of migrating polymorphic focal seizures, and progressive deterioration of psychomotor development. Seizures in MMPSI are refractory to conventional treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Early and multiple video/EEG recordings are critical to detect the characteristic multifocal and asynchronous long lasting ictal discharges and are essential for MMPSI diagnosis. MMPSI is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with few known etiologies.

Patients typically present with febrile hemiclonic or generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus, followed by the development of other seizure types including myoclonic, focal, absence and atonic seizures between 1-4 years. All seizure types are pharmacoresistent, but a trend toward less severe epilepsy and cognitive impairment is usually observed after the age of 5 years. Development is normal in the first year of life with subsequent developmental slowing and sometimes regression. Approximately 80% of patients have point mutations or small insertions or deletions in the SCN1A gene.','Nervous system disease','hsa04728','https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa04728+6323','H01818.png','Dopaminergic synapse');

HOW:	A psychosis probably exists if a patient demonstrates one or more of the following major criteria: MAJOR CRITERIA LOSS OF CONTACT WITH REALITY -- evidenced by the misinterpretation of the environment as hostile when friendly or vice versa, generally causing bizarre responses to normal and usual environmental stimuli. THOUGHT DISTURBANCE -- evidenced by incoherence, marked illogical content, marked loose associations, or patient\'s admission of mental confusion and abnormal rate of mental activity. PERSONALITY/BEHAVIOR CHANGES -- characterized by rapid onset and reversals of previous behavior patterns, often observed by reliable family member or friend. The diagnosis is further strengthened by the presence of one or more of the following minor criteria: MINOR CRITERIA DELUSIONS -- firmly held beliefs that cannot be dissuaded by logical discussion; generally of a threatening, powerful, or grandiose nature. ILLUSIONS -- misperceptions of environmental stimuli, e.g. perceiving a person instead of an actual tree shadow. HALLUCINATIONS -- perceptions without environmental stimuli, e.g. hearing voices/noises or seeing a face/vision.	REFS:	1) \"Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Features\".
