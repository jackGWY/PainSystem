    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Because pain involves clinical subjects, it can occur anywhere in the body, and its etiology is complex. Many pains are a typical syndrome or syndrome of a group of certain diseases, and can change with the development of the disease. Therefore, there is no uniform standard for the classification of pain, and the clinical classification methods are various, but it is more practical to combine the classification of pain properties, parts and causes.
